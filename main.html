          <b>A film </b> – also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, picture, photoplay or (slang)
          flick – is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates <b>ideas,
            stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere </b> through the use of moving images.
          These images are generally accompanied by sound and, more rarely, other sensory stimulations.
          The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry,
          and to the art form that is the result of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera,
          by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and
          computer animation,
          or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.
        </p>

            <b>Recording and transmission of film</b>
            <p>The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, by
              photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and
              computer animation,
              or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.</p>

            <p>Before the introduction of digital production, series of still images were recorded on a strip of
              chemically sensitized celluloid (photographic film stock), usually at the rate of 24 frames per second.
              The images are transmitted through a movie projector at the same rate as they were recorded, with a Geneva
              drive ensuring that each frame remains still during its short projection time. A rotating shutter causes
              stroboscopic intervals of darkness, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions due to flicker
              fusion. The apparent motion on the screen is the result of the fact that the visual sense cannot discern
              the individual images at high speeds, so the impressions of the images blend with the dark intervals and
              are thus linked together to produce the illusion of one moving image. An analogous optical soundtrack (a
              graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds)
              runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and was not projected.</p>
          <li>
            <b>Etymology and alternative terms</b>
            <p>The name "film" originally referred to the thin layer of photochemical emulsion
              on the celluloid strip that used to be the actual medium for recording and displaying motion pictures.</p>
            <p>Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including "picture", "picture show", "moving
              picture", "photoplay", and "flick". The most common term in the United States is "movie",
              while in Europe "film" is preferred. Archaic terms include "animated pictures" and "animated photography".
            </p>
            <p>"Flick" is in general a slang term, first recorded in 1926.
              It originates in the verb flicker, owing to the flickering appearance of early films.</p>
            <p>Common terms for the field in general include "the big screen", "the silver screen", "the movies",
              and "cinema"; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical
              essays.
              In early years, the word "sheet" was sometimes used instead of "screen".</p>

        <h3>Precursors
        </h3>
        <p>The art of film has drawn on several earlier traditions in fields such as oral storytelling, literature,
          theatre and visual arts.
          Forms of art and entertainment that had already featured moving and/or projected images include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>shadowgraphy -</b> probably used since prehistoric times
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>camera obscura -</b> a natural phenomenon that has possibly
            been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The magic lantern -</b> developed in the 1650s. The multi-media phantasmagoria shows that
            magic lanterns were popular from 1790 throughout the first half of the 19th century and could feature
            mechanical slides,
            rear projection, mobile projectors, superimposition, dissolving views, live actors,
            smoke (sometimes to project images upon), odors, sounds and even electric shocks.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Before celluloid</h3>
        <p>The stroboscopic animation principle was introduced in 1833 with the stroboscopic disc (better known as the
          phénakisticope) and later applied in the zoetrope (since 1866), the flip book (since 1868), and the
          praxinoscope (since 1877), before it became the basic principle for cinematography.

          Experiments with early phénakisticope-based animation projectors were made at least as early as 1843 and
          publicly screened in 1847. Jules Duboscq marketed phénakisticope projection systems in France from circa 1853
          until the 1890s.</p>
        <p>Photography was introduced in 1839, but initially photographic emulsions needed such long exposures that the
          recording of
          moving subjects seemed impossible. At least as early as 1844, photographic series of subjects posed in
          different positions
          have been created to either suggest a motion sequence or to document a range of different viewing angles. The
          advent of stereoscopic photography, with
          early experiments in the 1840s and commercial success since the early 1850s, raised interest in completing the
          photographic medium with the addition of means
          to capture colour and motion. In 1849, Joseph Plateau published about the idea to combine his invention of the
          phénakisticope with
          the stereoscope, as suggested to him by stereoscope inventor Charles Wheatstone, and to use photographs of
          plaster sculptures in different
          positions to be animated in the combined device. In 1852, Jules Duboscq patented such an instrument as the
          "Stéréoscope-fantascope,
          ou Bïoscope", but he only marketed it very briefly, without success. One Bïoscope disc with stereoscopic
          <br> photographs of a machine is in the Plateau collection of the Ghent University, but no instruments or
          other discs have yet been found.
        </p>
        <p>By the late 1850s the first examples of instantaneous photography came about and provided hope that motion
          photography
          would soon be possible, but it took a few decades before it was successfully combined with a method to record
          series of sequential images in real-time. In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge eventually managed to take a series of
          photographs of
          a running horse with a battery of cameras in a line along the track and published the results as The Horse
          in Motion on cabinet cards. Muybridge, as well as Étienne-Jules Marey, Ottomar Anschütz and many others,
          would create many more chronophotography studies. Muybridge had the contours of dozens of his
          chronophotographic series traced onto glass
          discs and projected them with his zoopraxiscope in his lectures from 1880 to 1895. Anschütz developed his own
          Electrotachyscope in 1887 to
          project 24 diapositive photographic images
          on glass disks as moving images, looped as long as deemed interesting for the audience.</p>

          The impact of a reviewer on a given film's box office performance is a matter of debate. Some observers claim
          that movie marketing in the 2000s is so intense, well-coordinated and well financed that reviewers cannot
          prevent a poorly written or filmed blockbuster from attaining market success. However, the cataclysmic failure
          of some heavily promoted films which were harshly reviewed, as well as the unexpected success of critically

          Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films. In general, these works can be divided into two
          categories: academic criticism by film scholars and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in
          newspapers and other media. Film critics working for newspapers, magazines, and broadcast media mainly review
          new releases.
